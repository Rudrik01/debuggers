Hello <img src="https://github.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/blob/df88815a7949b4a77698750667082fb51755de58/wave.gif" width="30px"> Visitors!

This project is a Tower of Hanoi game implemented in <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white" width="60px">.This project is made in group :family_man_man_boy:.In this project we learnt the real implementation of <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white" width="60px">

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks :minidisc: of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.
 
<h2><strong>Rules</strong></h2>
<p>:one: The game consists of three towers labeled A, B, and C.</p>
<p>:two: There are a number of disks of different sizes, initially arranged in a neat stack in ascending order on one tower, say tower A.</p>
<p>:three: The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another peg, say peg C, obeying the following simple rules:</p>
           <p align = "center">➡️Only one disk can be moved at a time.</p>
           <p align = "center">➡️Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty peg.</p>
           <p align = "center">➡️No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.</p>
<h2><strong>Technologies Used</strong></h2>
<p>:arrow_right: <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white" width="60px">: The game is implemented using <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white" width="60px"> Programming language.</p>
<p>:arrow_right: Standard Template Library (STL): The STL is used for data structures, such as vectors or arrays, to manage the game board and moves.</p>
<p>:arrow_right: Console-based user interface: The game uses the console as the user interface for interacting with the game.</p>
<h2><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h2>
<p>:one: C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Microsoft Visual C++)</p>
<p>:two: C++ standard library</p>
<h2><strong>Installation</strong></h2>
<p>:one: Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.</p>
<p>:two: Extract the contents of the ZIP file, if applicable.</p>
<p>:three: Compile the source code using a C++ compiler of your choice.</p>
<p>:four:Run the compiled executable to start the Tower of Hanoi game.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Play ? <img src = "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1b/dd/59/1bdd59c54518071ca002fcec3f65dedb.gif" width = "30px"></strong></h2>
<p>:one: Upon starting the game, you will be prompted to enter the choice to play or read instruction or exit the game.</p>
<p>:two: In play section,it will prompted you to enter the tower number from where the disk to be taken out.</p>
<p>:three: Then it will prompted you to enter the tower number for placing the disk.</p> 
<p>:four:The game will check if the move is valid according to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, and update the pegs accordingly.</p>
<p>:five:Continue making moves until you successfully move all the disks from the source peg to the target peg (i.e., all disks are stacked in ascending order on the target peg).</p>
